	* Added help comments in Makefile to clarify `make clean' and
	`make cleandata'.

	* Added the `experiment' example code into the code, but commented
	out.  The user need only uncomment the section and recompile.
	
	* Verified that `as-configured' simulation runs and pnm/mtv output
	are viewable.

	* Upgraded web page to include more documentation and the movies
	that JD Harrington made.  Aha, proof that someone besides me can
	download and run the code. 8)

	* Ripped both modulo type output routines out of the main() code
	and placed the in moduloOutput().  This makes main() easier to
	read and should simplify maintenance on the identical code.  The
	single point output code will remain in main() as it is about the
	same size either way and would not lend the code to be any more
	readable.

	* Created ToyPlaneFDTD. to contain commonly defined information
	and facilitate breakout of output routines into output.c

	* Makefile removing incorrect viz file, old naming convention

	* Commented Schneider, Flynn, Shlager code to clarify where it
	comes from.

	* Making the testc should remove all previous data.  Made it
	depend on cleandata which would clear all old bob files, etc
	leaving a clean slate for the new data to be produced.

	* Decided against any ABC (Mur 1st order, Mur 2nd order, et
	cetera) in this version which would map the ABC's into a
	ToyAirport Code to be consistent with the 3D Toy codes.  This will
	limit utility of the code and yet should enhance readability on
	this base version against which the ToyAirport codes are to be
	built.

	* Changed problem to simple propagation and scattering.  Waveguide
	resonance example was looking a bit esoteric in this code.

	* Tweaked the problem section to work a waveguide resonance
	system.  This allows the code to remain with PEC outer boundaries
	as an example code.

	* Performed a few checks of the PNM and MTV output formats for
	each of the #define options.  Certainly not rigorous, but it
	should work for you.

	* Easily the kernel calculations have been almost lost within the
	output routines and basic maintenance.  Thus, the `care and
	feeding' of the time-domain local-operator kernsls is the
	overwhelming burden even in a 2D code.

	* PNM output always autoscales now.  Look at the runLog
	information for the actual values of the scaling

	* Even though E_NORMAL or H_NORMAL are selected, one might still
	want to output the fields within the plane.  Options to output
	those fields added.  This is thoroughly messy, yet remains less
	messy when compared to parsing code for user or file input.
	
	* Added boiler plate, GPL, and other assorted header comments
	describing the code.

	* Added more precision to the constants which should alleviate any
	roundoff flaws or differences between machine files.  It's a bit
	of overkill, but it should lend consistency to the various
	machines that people run with.
