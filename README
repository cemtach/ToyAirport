	Basic 2D FDTD

2 niizh

	Variation in array memory allocation, from a contiguous array
	to split allocation.  Compare speed.  Smaller allocations may
	show little difference as the entire system may fit within
	cache or the I/O may limit the speed, for example.  Try
	increasing the simulation size, or reducing the requested I/O.

	Illustrates a higher order stencil outlined by Lan, Liu, and
	Lin in "A Higher Order (2,4) Scheme for Reducing Dispersion in FDTD
	Algorithm", IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility, volume
	41, number 2, May 1999.  Compare the results from naanan to the basic
	ToyPlaneFDTD. What was gained and what was lost by this
	modification?
